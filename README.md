## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

The experience of tackling this challenge has taught me a valuable lesson: simplicity often holds the key to success. Initially, I believed that creating the graph would require complex techniques beyond my grasp. However, I discovered that employing straightforward methods, such as utilizing flexbox for layout, proved to be effective. This realization underscored the importance of embracing simplicity in problem-solving. Additionally, delving into JavaScript for this task was both enlightening and engaging. While I didn't opt for intricate solutions, I still encountered valuable learning opportunities through this educational endeavor.

### Continued development

I was thinking on trying to make this into a React project and make a graph component. I am also going to remake this project but use a 3rd party library instead of vanilla javascript.
